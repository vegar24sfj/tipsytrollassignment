            As you make your way down the narrow, cobbled street, a warm glow
            beckons from behind a weathered sign adorned with a flickering
            candle. The sign reads, The Roaring Hearth, and the scent of
            roasting meat and freshly baked bread drifts through the cool night
            air.
